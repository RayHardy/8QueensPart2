# 8QueensPart2

An object oriented approach to solve the 8 queens approach

The major difference between this and 8 queens part 1 is that this code as edge detection and solves the problem by knowing what it is.

This C++ project was used with Xcode in MacOS. This could also be used in other environments. If using in other environments then use just main.cpp 8queens.cpp 8queens.hpp.
